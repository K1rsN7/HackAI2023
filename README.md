<div align='center'><h2>All-Russian hackathon "Digital Breakthrough. Season: Artificial Intelligence" (2023)
Case: Intelligent voice assistant for drivers</h2></div>

Computer configuration on which everything worked:
  1. OC: Windows 10/11
  2. Pycharm 2022.01.01
  3. Python 3.10
  4. RAM 8 gb

Instructions for use:
1. Unzip the archive with the files and from the repository to any convenient place on your computer
2. Open the folder with the files in a convenient environment for you (in our case Pycharm)
3. find the main.py file and compile it  
3. After compilation, say the activation phrase "Hello Anya" and wait for the assistant to process your speech. If the phrase was said correctly, you will hear a notification.
4. The next step is for you to state the fault. After processing, the assistant will voice the solution to your problem.

If for some reason the activation phrase does not work, press the "ALT" button and wait for the model to skip this step. Then see step 4.

**Important Note:** The Assistant does not recognize numbers greater than 9. Therefore, for example, the number 43 should be pronounced as "four three" and we accept only Russian speech.
